In the past couple months, I've been fortunate to have had a couple very strong forces act on my life and push me in a few particular directions of thought. All of those will be explored through this blog (hopefully) at some point; the goal is to provide a more comprehensive picture of how I think and what I'm thinking about, almost like context engineering for relationships. I'm sure this will also be helpful for me to learn how different audiences react to how I communicate and learn better methods of doing so as a result.

In general, I'm hoping that this will be some sort of repository for me to maintain a timeline of some of the key insights that I've come across and want to share with more than just myself, whether in regards to some of the more interesting technical problems and trends I've been working on or just in general in regards to thoughts about life.

I hope that in this journey of tending my own life garden, you'll find a couple saplings that you want to take back and plant in yours as well, and maybe you can share a seedling or two with me too.
